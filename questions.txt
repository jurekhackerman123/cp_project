

- can we consider the angular momentum conserved? 
- can we assume constant velocity? so that ddot(phi) = 0
- how should we implement the stabil orbit in the code? 
	- is it going to work only by implementing the formulas? 
	- or do we have to say if R = 3*Rs -> r = const.
	- and if r smaller -> U = Ueff -> star falls in

- And then if r > Rs -> just kepler potential
(because outside of 3*Rs Kepler orbits are possible, so we neglect the 1/r^3 term)

- We just have to simulate it properly I guess, not have all the physics completely correct. 


Then do it for many particles 

That's where Rt comes in 

- if r <= Rt -> activate Ueff at the same time for all particles that make up star
- and make the particles interact with each other 

- the equation for the black hole potential would change, since L is not conserved anymore  

One other point:

we only consider radial velocities, so we start as soon as the star is 

if we want to see the differences more clearly in the plot we have to just consider bigger delta x, so that
die entfernung vom BH relativ zur distance kleiner wird

- things to do:
